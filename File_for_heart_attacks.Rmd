Aufgabe 1 
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
#remove(list = ls())
df_heart_deaths <- read_csv("C:/Users/adria/Desktop/Programmieren/R_Coursera/week_4_project/data/outcome-of-care-measures.csv")

head(df_heart_deaths)
names(df_heart_deaths)

library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

df_heart_deaths %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = as.numeric(as.character(`Hospital 30-Day Death (Mortality) Rates from Heart Attack`)))) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(x = "30-Tage Mortalitätsrate durch Herzinfarkte",
       y = "Häufigkeit")

```

Aufgabe 2 
Write a function that finds the "best" hospital in terms of 
```{r}
best <- function(state, outcome){
  # maybe use here the read in function
  for (s in state){
  df_area <- df_heart_deaths %>%              # uses filter in a for loop
      filter(State == s)                      # to get just data for the 
  }                                           # argument state 
   
  for (o in outcome) {
  outc <-  paste("Hospital 30-Day Death (Mortality) Rates from", o, sep = " ")
                                    # using paste to get col name from argument
  df_area <- df_area %>%
    select(outc, "Hospital Name")          # using select to have a nice time 
       
                                       # just handling with relevant cols
   rate_vec <- unlist(df_area[,1], use.names = F)    # must unlist outc bc of struggle w/ mutate
    df_area[,1] <- as.numeric(rate_vec)
   df_area <- df_area %>% 
        drop_na()
   
   mini <- min(df_area[,1])
                               # so get a vector to calculate the minimum from
   
  pos <- which(df_area[,1] == mini)   # have to find of the index of min element of the vector
                                          # for an indize to search in the df for getting the
                                          # to the minimized outcome related hospital
   best_clinic <- df_area$"Hospital Name"[pos]
  }
  best_clinic
}

best(state = "OR", outcome = "Heart Attack")

```


```{r}
df_heart_deaths$`Hospital Name`

state_names <- df_heart_deaths %>%
  select(State) %>% 
  distinct() %>%
  unlist(use.names = F) %>%
  as.vector()

state_names

best(state = "RI", outcome = "Heart Failure")


```
